//3. Consider that a polynomial is represented as an arraylist of Term s where term has values for coefficient(float ) and exponent (integer) with variable always assumed as x. Zeroeth element in the arraylist is for lowest power/exponent and subsequent terms corresponding to higher powers (i.e. terms stored as sorted order of exponents).
//
//write class Term, with appropriate attributes and proper constructor and accessor methods.
//
//write class Polynomial which provides for constructing a polAynomial and also provides methods add which allows adding another polynomial to it and return new polynomial.
//{  e.g. addition of  2 x^-1 + 3 x^2 and
//                   4 x + 2 x^2
